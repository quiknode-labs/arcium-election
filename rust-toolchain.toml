# IMPORTANT: Arcium 0.6.2 requires Rust 1.88.0+ due to:
# - arcis-interpreter 0.6.2 uses proc_macro_span (stabilized in 1.88.0)
# - zmij 1.0.2 (transitive dep via serde_json) uses select_unpredictable (stabilized in 1.88.0)
# Both features were stabilized in Rust 1.88.0, so no workarounds are needed.
# See ARCIUM_UPGRADE_NOTES.md for full details and rationale.
